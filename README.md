## About this project

This is one of my earliest Python projects — a simple calculator built using Tkinter.

After completing basic Python training, my mentor challenged me to build something on my own. Half-jokingly, he suggested a calculator. I took it seriously, built this overnight, and presented it to him the next day.

The project reflects my early understanding of GUI programming, event handling, and basic expression evaluation. While the code isn’t optimized by modern standards (e.g., use of globals and `eval()`), it’s intentionally kept close to its original form as a snapshot of my learning journey.
